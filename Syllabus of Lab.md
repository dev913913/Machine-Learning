1. Read the numeric data from .CSV file and use some basic operation on it.
2. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree algorithm. Use an
appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify
a new sample.
3. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the Random Forest algorithm.
4. Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data
set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test
data sets.
5. Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naïve Bayesian
Classifier model to perform this task. Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write
the program. Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.
6. Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this
model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart Disease
Data Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.
7. Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data
set. Print both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be
used for this problem.
8. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the K-means clustering algorithm.
9. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the Support Vector Machine for
Classification Algorithm.
10. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the Hierarchical Clustering
